Games::AIBots
=============

This is a fork of the Games::AIBots v0.03 module from CPAN, originally written
by Autrijus Tang. I updated the code to fix a small bug that was preventing the
game from running on modern Perl. Check git history for my changes.

The original README follows.

See http://www.tacticalneuronics.com/ai.htm for general information
about this game, and doc/aibots.html for the (admittedly very rough)
